## :blush: **About**

<p>
This is a tool that a I'v made for myself to find out what are the most rated technologies for Back-End developers job offers on Google search results.
We are often faced with the question "what technology should I learn first?" and we keep wasting our time studying something that has nothing to do with the career we seek to achieve. so I hope that this app help you answer this questions.
It allows you to add technology names to be searched within job offers as keywords, then returns how many times the name of this technology appears within each job offer that Google has listed. For now, it can only search for keywords in back-end job offers, but job categories and other development careers will be supported soon, any help would be very wellcome!
Maybe some people think that the UI is not totally adequate for this application or a little exaggerated, the reason is that when I started this project I was looking to challenge myself by doing something unusual.
